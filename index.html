			Picture-in-Picture made its first appearance on the web in the Safari
			browser with the release of macOS Sierra in 2016. It made it possible
			for a user to pop a video out into a small floating window that stays
			above all others, so that they can keep watching while doing other
			things. Itâ€™s an idea that came from TV, where, for example, you might
			want to keep watching your Popular Sporting Event even as you browse the
			guide or even other channels.
